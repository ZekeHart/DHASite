    "text": "I’m Ashley Canady, and my address is [address omitted], and if you’re supporting McDougald, stand up! I have everybody here with me. A lot of these people are coming from McDougald. I’m coming from McDougald Terrace, and I’m here today because our community is suffering. We have a lot of our loved ones that are displaced. This week has been very hectic. I got back in town right before New Years and I know I put at least 233 hours or more in McDougald Terrace, and I don’t get paid. That’s people that are doing the job — the job that I’m doing, are getting paid. Day in and day out. Some days, I leave at 1:00 in the morning. I’m a single mother of four kids. Something’s got to give. Something’s got to give for our community. We’re out here tonight asking the city, the county, whoever it may be to come out to McDougald and help us. I’ve been receiving donations all day. All day long. And our volunteers have worked all day long. All weekend. Feeding thousands of people. Today was my first decent meal in almost a week. I’m running off of four hours of sleep. I have a headache right now. But I’m here with my residents. So I just want the city and everybody else to figure out what we can do to get our loved ones home in a safe and clean environment. Because guess what? Y’all wouldn’t want to live there. Nobody would want their kids living in these conditions right now. How would y’all feel if one of y’all woke up in the morning and one of your babies wasn’t living? I have so many parents telling me that they stand up watching their kids sleep just to make sure they’re not taking their last breath. Come on y’all, something has got to give."

    "text": "Hi, good evening. Samanther Crowder. [address omitted]. My question is, to the City of Durham, have you ever had to look in your baby’s eyes and fear death because of the conditions of your living situation? When your rent is paid, and you’ve been a resident at this place for four years. You’ve got bubbles in your ceiling, just terrible conditions. Mold in the bathroom that I can’t fight. They glazed the tub with paint so it stops up. Clogs the whole drain. It’s like you’re taking a shower in a river or something. It’s inhumane, absolutely ridiculous. You call in for a work order, it takes months, weeks to get some help. You have to constantly call to get something as simple as a tub unclogged. The way the buildings are set up, if one toilet or one tub is backed up, the entire building is backed up. Have you ever flushed your toilet and your feces comes up in your tub? That’s what we deal with in McDougald on the regular. That’s no lie. This is what I had my baby breathing in. She will be six months on the 29th. She came home into those conditions. I got in connection with Durham connection, they came out and tested my unit, I have proof. THERE’S lead based paint there. She will be moving around soon. Every day, I look in her eyes in fear, because of my living conditions I don’t know what could possibly happen. And really there’s nothing I can do about it right now other than stand up and say what I experienced living in McDougald Terrance. It’s the honest god truth. Please, you guys, help us, please. I’m displaced. I have five children. I have to get one child to KIPP Durham, another son to Dps elementary, my oldest daughter to Hillside high school. I don’t have a vehicle. I can’t go outside and put them on the bus from the Days Inn hotel. It’s frustrating. I don’t know where our next meal is coming from. I appreciate all the resources that everybody’s helping — thank you so much, Ashley — but this is really stressful. On another level of being stressful. I never thought that it would come to this. And I don’t see them actually fixing the issues that we have. It’s unfixable. If each and every one of you guys were to come in just my one apartment for an hour, I ain’t even gonna give you six months, in an hour you’ll be ready to go. Five minutes, you’ll be ready to go!"

    "text": "My name is Shaunkyra Douglas, a lot of people know me as Cymone. I live at [address omitted]. He said he was gonna let us know when it’s safe for us to go home. What proof can we have that it’s safe for us to go home? Because we thought it was safe to live there, and apparently, it wasn’t. I don’t get it. I’m completely in awe. I have a 1-year-old and a six month old. They’re tiny. My next-door neighbor, her child was the first to pass away. That’s scary. From the time her child passed till now, I have been scared to go to sleep, I’m scared to put my kids down for a nap. We’re not even home because I’m so scared. I’ll even go to my aunt’s house for my kids to sleep. That’s a terrible feeling. It’s ridiculous. They don’t care. We’re humans, and I don’t know how many times I’ve got to say it, but we’re struggling. We’re struggling as it as because we’re living in McDougald. They make it worse by not caring. I was told of an inspection, three years of inspections that have failed, with McDougald terrace that have failed under 60. Under 60 is failing. If you’ve known for three years that the score ws under 60, why did you continue to let people live there like that? That’s ridiculous. If you wouldn’t want your kids, your mama, your grandma or anybody in your family going through this, why put other people through it? And granted, the maintenance man, they can’t do it all, housing authority, they swear they can’t do it all, can y’all help us? That’s all we’re asking for, a little bit of help. If you move me to another neighborhood, just make sure my kids are safe. That’s all I care about are my babies. I’d rather go than let them go. But with this, all of us are gonna go together. It shouldn’t be like that. We got to get up here and beg y’all for help. It shouldn’t have came to us begging. We’re not dogs."

    "text": "Hi, my name is Laura Betty. I live at [address omitted]. I feel like I’m around family. I saw Mr. Schewel spooning out pasta, Charlie — I mean, Mr. Reece, you know, Miss Jillian. The community has got together, everybody, and they really did a wonderful job in trying to organize help for the evacuated residents. My concern is the children. And specifically, their educational needs, the fact that they do need a stable home. I’m not sure that DHA has the funds to renew and to repair everything, and if you could just possibly do your best to hurry up the process. If it’s a matter of relocating the residents, please keep in mind the children. We all know the way out of poverty is knowledge. We don’t want to interrupt that flow of knowledge. So please, I beg you, think of the children. Relocate, if they have to be relocated, relocate the parents as soon as possible so the children have a stable environment, a stable learning environment. Thank you so much."

    "text": "Good evening, Mr. Mayor. My name is Anthony McLendon. My apartment is in the red. I had — I think I’ve been back there for three years, I had three babies that was born there. I had to live in this without my knowledge. But I kept wondering why that indicator kept coming up, and I had to keep reaching up there to turn it off. Come to find out it’s carbon monoxide. Before all this went down, the day before, I got tested, they told me my test at 0. My doctor was watching the news. She called me in for an emergency checkup. She put it on my finger, I registered at 11. She took my blood, called me six hours later, told me I had carbon monoxide at a level 7. My grandson registered at 17. Now, I have two grandbabies in the house I have to watch sleep every night. My first good night’s sleep was last night, because I’d been so stressed out. I almost had a fucking stroke over this. We voted for most of y’all up in here. We put you back in that chair. All we’re asking for is a little help. Because I’m gonna tell you something, your reelection is gonna come up again, you're gonna run for something, and we are not gonna put you back in the spot that you’re in now. Goes for you too, Mr. Mayor. I thank Ashley for everything she has done, that’s my goddaughter. She has been doing a wonderful job. And everybody else who chipped in on this effort, including myself. But we don’t have to live like this. Mr. Scott and them knew better. They knew what was going on. This is not surprising, it’s no surprise to you either because y’all know what’s going on, y'all watch the news, with the sewage, and the babies dying. Thank you."

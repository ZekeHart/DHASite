    "text": "I’m Ashley Canady, and my address is [address omitted], and if you’re supporting McDougald, stand up! I have everybody here with me. A lot of these people are coming from McDougald. I’m coming from McDougald Terrace, and I’m here today because our community is suffering. We have a lot of our loved ones that are displaced. This week has been very hectic. I got back in town right before New Years and I know I put at least 233 hours or more in McDougald Terrace, and I don’t get paid. That’s people that are doing the job — the job that I’m doing, are getting paid. Day in and day out. Some days, I leave at 1:00 in the morning. I’m a single mother of four kids. Something’s got to give. Something’s got to give for our community. We’re out here tonight asking the city, the county, whoever it may be to come out to McDougald and help us. I’ve been receiving donations all day. All day long. And our volunteers have worked all day long. All weekend. Feeding thousands of people. Today was my first decent meal in almost a week. I’m running off of four hours of sleep. I have a headache right now. But I’m here with my residents. So I just want the city and everybody else to figure out what we can do to get our loved ones home in a safe and clean environment. Because guess what? Y’all wouldn’t want to live there. Nobody would want their kids living in these conditions right now. How would y’all feel if one of y’all woke up in the morning and one of your babies wasn’t living? I have so many parents telling me that they stand up watching their kids sleep just to make sure they’re not taking their last breath. Come on y’all, something has got to give."

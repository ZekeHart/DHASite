            <p class="main-text">
                I’m Ashley Canady, and my address is [address omitted], and if you’re supporting McDougald, stand up! I have everybody here with me. A lot of these people are coming from McDougald. I’m coming from McDougald Terrace, and I’m here today because our community is suffering. We have a lot of our loved ones that are displaced. This week has been very hectic. I got back in town right before New Years and I know I put at least 233 hours or more in McDougald Terrace, and I don’t get paid. That’s people that are doing the job — the job that I’m doing, are getting paid. Day in and day out. Some days, I leave at 1:00 in the morning. I’m a single mother of four kids. Something’s got to give. Something’s got to give for our community. We’re out here tonight asking the city, the county, whoever it may be to come out to McDougald and help us. I’ve been receiving donations all day. All day long. And our volunteers have worked all day long. All weekend. Feeding thousands of people. Today was my first decent meal in almost a week. I’m running off of four hours of sleep. I have a headache right now. But I’m here with my residents. So I just want the city and everybody else to figure out what we can do to get our loved ones home in a safe and clean environment. Because guess what? Y’all wouldn’t want to live there. Nobody would want their kids living in these conditions right now. How would y’all feel if one of y’all woke up in the morning and one of your babies wasn’t living? I have so many parents telling me that they stand up watching their kids sleep just to make sure they’re not taking their last breath. Come on y’all, something has got to give.

            <p class="main-text">
                My name is Jontay Dunston, I’m a Durham resident, a city taxpayer. I’d also like to say good evening to my brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers, and our community. What can I say has already been said. But the one main person I’m disappointed in is you, Mayor. You didn’t show up to the first meeting we had. I had people coming up to me asking, “what do you think about this Mayor, JD?”. And I said, “well, you know, we’re gonna give him a chance”. The first time you was elected, because people had they eyes about you. I’d say, you know what, it’s a conflict of interest when city council members run for mayor, but I thought the mayor is picked from the people. To make this long story short, as a father, and looking at my kids every night, I had to lose contracts because of the conditions my kids live in. They haven’t had no heat in their apartment since the beginning of November. Roofs are leaking. Fuse box smells like electrical. Every night — and oh, by the way, it took three weeks for them to come in and unclog our tub. You know how embarrassing that is to go to people’s houses and ask “can my kids take a bath?” I had to get a hotel for a couple of weeks for them just to go bathe theirselves. Let’s just say again, would you live under those conditions? You know what, Anthony, this is directed at you. I don’t believe you need to be fired, I believe you need to spend six weeks over there. I’m calling this as it is, y’all are looking at a political war right now. It’s only two people up here that I have confidence in. You don’t have to worry about your job. I love y’all.

            <p class="main-text">
                Hi, good evening. Samantha Crowder. [address omitted]. My question is, to the city of durham, have you ever had to look in your baby’s eyes and fear death because of the conditions of your living situation? When your rent is paid, and you’ve been a resident at this place for four years. You’ve got bubbles in your ceiling, just terrible conditions. Mold in the bathroom that I can’t fight. They glazed the tub with paint so it stops up. Clogs the whole drain. It’s like you’re taking a shower in a river or something. It’s inhumane, absolutely ridiculous. You call in for a work order, it takes months, weeks to get some help. You have to constantly call to get something as simple as a tub unclogged. The way the buildings are set up, if one toilet or one tub is backed up, the entire building is backed up. Have you ever flushed your toilet and your feces comes up in your tub? That’s what we deal with in McDougald on the regular. That’s no lie. This is what I had my baby breathing in. She will be six months on the 29th. She came home into those conditions. I got in connection with Durham connection, they came out and tested my unit, I have proof. THERE’S lead based paint there. She will be moving around soon. Every day, I look in her eyes in fear, because of my living conditions I don’t know what could possibly happen. And really there’s nothing I can do about it right now other than stand up and say what I experienced living in McDougald Terrance. It’s the honest god truth. Please, you guys, help us, please. I’m displaced. I have five children. I have to get one child to KIPP Durham, another son to Dps elementary, my oldest daughter to Hillside high school. I don’t have a vehicle. I can’t go outside and put them on the bus from the Days Inn hotel. It’s frustrating. I don’t know where our next meal is coming from. I appreciate all the resources that everybody’s helping — thank you so much, Ashley — but this is really stressful. On another level of being stressful. I never thought that it would come to this. And I don’t see them actually fixing the issues that we have. It’s unfixable. If each and every one of you guys were to come in just my one apartment for an hour, I ain’t even gonna give you six months, in an hour you’ll be ready to go. Five minutes, you’ll be ready to go!

            <p class="main-text">
                My name is Shaunkyra Douglas, a lot of people know me as Cymone. I live at [address omitted]. He said he was gonna let us know when it’s safe for us to go home. What proof can we have that it’s safe for us to go home? Because we thought it was safe to live there, and apparently, it wasn’t. I don’t get it. I’m completely in awe. I have a 1-year-old and a six month old. They’re tiny. My next-door neighbor, her child was the first to pass away. That’s scary. From the time her child passed till now, I have been scared to go to sleep, I’m scared to put my kids down for a nap. We’re not even home because I’m so scared. I’ll even go to my aunt’s house for my kids to sleep. That’s a terrible feeling. It’s ridiculous. They don’t care. We’re humans, and I don’t know how many times I’ve got to say it, but we’re struggling. We’re struggling as it as because we’re living in McDougald. They make it worse by not caring. I was told of an inspection, three years of inspections that have failed, with McDougald terrace that have failed under 60. Under 60 is failing. If you’ve known for three years that the score ws under 60, why did you continue to let people live there like that? That’s ridiculous. If you wouldn’t want your kids, your mama, your grandma or anybody in your family going through this, why put other people through it? And granted, the maintenance man, they can’t do it all, housing authority, they swear they can’t do it all, can y’all help us? That’s all we’re asking for, a little bit of help. If you move me to another neighborhood, just make sure my kids are safe. That’s all I care about are my babies. I’d rather go than let them go. But with this, all of us are gonna go together. It shouldn’t be like that. We got to get up here and beg y’all for help. It shouldn’t have came to us begging. We’re not dogs.

            <p class="main-text">
                Good evening, I’m Larry Hunter, and I’m in [address omitted]. That’s considered the alleyway. Anyway, my apartment, for example, I have gone to the management office several times. Feces was backing up in my tub, when I try to wash my clothes, brown water is backing up in my sink where I’m supposed to wash dishes. unsanitary. Some of the apartments have mold in them. My bedroom, at the lower part, I can see dark stuff down there. Like the water is about to seep into the building. I have sprayed and done several things to try to correct it. I wake up sometimes — before I left — during the night, and see a bug that big. Where it come from? Where did it come from? That’s because the foundation of those buildings over there is no good. You all need to help us. You really do, because the living conditions for us — we are humans, just like you all are. I know you all are in great housing. We’re over there, you step outside and there’s trash everywhere. The inside of the buildings are just torn to pieces. You’re talking about a building that’s 50-something years ago. They say move out, stay out for 7 days. You cannot fix that issue in 7 days.

                Hi, my name is Laura Betty. I live at [address omitted]. I feel like I’m around family. I saw Mr. Schewel spooning out pasta, Charlie — I mean, Mr. Reece, um, you know, Miss Jillian.. the community has got together, everybody, and they really did a wonderful job in trying to organize help for the evacuated residents. My concern is the children. Specifically, their educational needs, the fact that they do need a stable home, and I’m not sure that DHA has the funds to renew and repair everything. If you could just possibly do your best to hurry up the process, if it’s a matter of relocating the residents, please keep in mind the children. We all know the way out of poverty is knowledge. We don’t want to interrupt that flow of knowledge. Please, I beg you, think of the children. If they have to be relocated, relocate the parents as soon as possible so the children have a stable learning environment. Thank you very much.

            <h3 class="speaker">Anthony McLendon</h3>
            <p class="main-text">
                Good evening, Mr. Mayor. My name is Anthony McLendon. My apartment is in the red. I had — I think I’ve been back there for three years, I had three babies there. I had to live in this without my knowledge. But I kept wondering why that indicator kept coming up, and I had to keep reaching up there to turn it off. Come to find out it’s carbon monoxide. Before all this went down, the day before I got tested, they told me my apartment tested at 0. My doctor was watching the news. She called me in for an emergency checkup. She took my blood, called me six hours later, told me I had carbon monoxide level 7. My grandson registered at 17. Now I have two grandbabies in the house I have to watch sleep every night. My first good night’s sleep was last night because I’d been so stressed out. I almost had a fucking stroke over this. We voted for most of y’all up in here. We put you back in that chair. All we’re asking for is a little help. I’m gonna tell you something, your reelection is coming up again, and we are not gonna put you back in the spot that you’re in now. Goes for you too, Mr. Mayor. I thank Ashley for everything she’s done, that’s my goddaughter. She has been doing a wonderful job. And everybody else who chipped in on this effort, including myself. But we don’t have to live like this. Mr. Scott knew better. They knew what was going on. This is not surprising, it’s no surprise to you either because y’all know what’s going on with the sewage, and the babies dying. Thank you.

            <p class="main-text">
                I’m Lashanda Orman, I’m in [address omitted], and I’m here to support my whole neighborhood and also bring up the fact that I have mold in my ceilings in my kitchen. i have three children at the ages of 5, 6, and 10, two of them with athsma. We have not had the carbon monoxide in my building, but it’s the mold that I’m worried about. I went over to the apartment today to grab things, there was somebody in there patching up the ceiling. When I noticed it, he said, “I think I’m gonna knock this down to see if it’s really mold in here.” The spots I was showing him I knew for sure was bubbling up because of the mold under there where the water from the tub is coming through my kitchen where my toilet overflowed when I wasn’t even home last week and went over all my dishes. He tried to ignore that. So it’s not Miss Lisa, it’s not Chris, it’s not bruce, neither is it Miss Roberts. Anthony Scott, where are the real contractors at? You have these jackleg contractors coming in there doing it the easy way. Covering it up. He sprayed something called killer in my cabinets. I asked him, “between the ceiling and the cabinets, what do you think is in the middle of that? Mold.” All the cabinets need to come out. I’m not trying to lose any of my children. My daughter has been complaining about headaches. She’s six years old. I’ve never had to worry with her about headaches. All of the sudden, she’s been complaining about headaches. She had a leak in her ceiling in her room from a bad storm we had. Someone was on top of the roof patching it up. They didn’t come — they were supposed to come back and check inside of her ceiling for mold. They didn’t come and do any of it. Like I said, it’s not the managers. Anthony Scott, if you’ve heard all this stuff about the failures in the inspections, why haven’t you taken care of it? Why haven’t you tried to fix it? We need help. I’m tired of living in a hotel with no kitchen. I need the help; we need the help. We need answers.

            <p class="main-text">
                Hi, my name is Antonisha Bernett. First off, I just want to start by saying, do you guys have to beg us for rent money every month? We shouldn’t have to beg you guys to come out and fix something, especially these people who have young children. When I first moved into my apartment, I was pregnant. My daughter was born two months early. She had to stay in the hospital, she had to receive steroid shots to develop her lungs. When I brought her home, Miss Roberts told me to get a letter so I could be moved out of McDougald because the gas heat was effecting my daughter. My daughter has athsma. No one did anything, they didn’t even want to accept my letter to transfer me out. That’s a set up for something to happen to my child. I get tired of staying up every night, only getting an hour of sleep scared, watching my children breathe. Because I’m just so scared something will happen to them. I jut want to put out there, my nephew was Britain brown. That was the child that died December 8th. No one did anything. You didn’t even come out, Mr. Scott. You didn’t even try to do anything until she come to the meeting at Burton and spoke. Then you wanna come and give hugs, and act like you have some sympathy, when you guys should’ve been having sympathy for us when we’re putting in work orders complaining about mold, about ceilings caving in, about plumbing. You guys sitting here and charging us $20 to get our tubs and sinks unstopped but it’s been plumbing issues from day 1. And you guys know that because you have contractors coming out digging so many feet holes to try to fix a situation that is not going to get fixed. This is ridiculous. I’m pretty sure you guys have families, I know you guys go home and live comfortably, happy with their families, well you know a lot of mothers like my brother’s girlfriend, she doesn’t get to go home and see her child every day. Because now my nephew is laying in the iron. How do you think that makes us feel? Our time was cut short with my nephew because of carbon monoxide poisoning. This is ridiculous, and y’all need to do something ASAP, not just temporarily. This needs to be a long term plan. Y’all need to figure it out.

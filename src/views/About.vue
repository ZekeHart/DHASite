          <li class="about-list">Inspections of 70 DHA units revealed 28 of them had high Carbon Monoxide levels.</li>
          <li class="about-list">Half of all DHA properties scored below 60 the last time they were inspected by HUD and Mcdougald Terrace has failed each of the last three years.</li>

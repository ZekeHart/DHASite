      <h2>Hundreds of McDougald Terrace residents have evacuated due to carbon monoxide levels and are staying in twelve different hotels.

        <ul class='list-container'>
          <li class="about-list">There have been many reports of mold, sewage backing up into units, and gas leaks.</li>
          <li class="about-list">Inspections of 70 DHA units revealed 28 of them had high Carbon Monoxide levels.</li>
          <li class="about-list">Half of all DHA properties scored below 60 the last time they were inspected by HUD and Mcdougald Terrace has failed each of the last three years.</li>
